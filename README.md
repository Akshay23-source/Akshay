Titanic Survival Prediction
This project is a machine learning model that predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more. It uses the famous Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle.
Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. In this project, we aim to predict which passengers survived the disaster based on features like gender, age, passenger class, and more using machine learning techniques.
Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

Approach
We followed these steps in the project:

Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Dealt with missing values in the dataset.
Analyzed the relationship between features and survival rate.

Feature Engineering:
Created new features based on existing data (e.g., Family Size, Title from Name).
Encoded categorical variables like Sex and Embarked.

Modeling:
Built various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
Tuned model hyperparameters using cross-validation.
Compared model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

Evaluation:
Used the test set to evaluate the final model.
Visualized important features influencing survival.

Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset. The most important features influencing survival were:
Sex: Females had a higher survival rate.
Pclass: Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had a better chance of survival.
Age: Younger passengers were more likely to survive.

Future Improvements
Perform more feature engineering.
Experiment with advanced models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
Optimize hyperparameters further using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
